# trainTimes

This app allows users to add and keep track of different trains using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Google Firebase

To get started, clone the repo to your computer and either use your own firebase information in assets/javascript/logic.js or use the information already there.

You can open index.html in your browser to see the app in action
